        <p class="text-size2">“Our Maison reinvents the inestimable heritage and savoir-faire inspired by Monsieur Dior, a dream that embodies Parisian haute couture.

            We share this dream with our customers around the world through our values of excellence, innovation and bold creativity.”
            Christian Dior was a French fashion designer whose post-World War II creations were wildly popular, and whose legacy continues to influence the fashion industry.

            Christian Dior was born on January 21, 1905, in Granville, a seaside town in the north of France. He was the second of five children born to 
            Alexandre Louis Maurice Dior, the owner of a highly successful fertilizer manufacturer, and his wife, Isabelle. When he was a boy, Dior's family moved to Paris, 
            where he would spend his youth. Dior's family had hopes he would become a diplomat, but Dior was artistic and wished to be involved in art.  
            Although Dior expressed an interest in becoming an architect, he submitted to pressure from his father and, in 1925, enrolled at the École des Sciences Politiques 
            to begin his studies in political science, with the understanding that he would eventually find work as a diplomat.
            
            After his graduation in 1928, however, Dior opened a small art gallery with money he received from his father, who had agreed to lend his son his financial support 
            on the condition that the family name would not appear above the gallery door. In the few years it was open, Dior's gallery handled the works of such notable artists 
            as Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau and Max Jacob. He was forced to close the gallery in 1931, a year that included the deaths of both his older brother 
            and mother and the financial collapse of his father's business.</p>
